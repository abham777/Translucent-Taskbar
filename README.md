# Translucent Taskbar Skin
This is a Rainmeter skin for Windows 10. Once added, your taskbar will become as clear as glass.

Skins in the Rainmeter Skin Packager (.rmskin) format can be easily and automatically installed with the Rainmeter Skin Installer. During a normal Rainmeter installation, the .rmskin extension is associated in Windows with the Skin Installer program, and simply double-clicking the file will install it in Rainmeter.
